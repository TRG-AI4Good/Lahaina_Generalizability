# RAPID_A
### This code serve as the re-production tool for the article (DOI), aimed at adding generalizability to rapid post-event damage assessment through satellite imagery.

### The code offers step-by-step data generation, channel augmentation, ensemble learning, and test-time augmentation strategies outlined in the paper to evaluate their impacts on adding generalizability to rapid post-event damage assessment through satellite imagery.

* Cloning the repo in your system:
```bash 
cd /path/to/directory
git clone https://github.com/TRG-AI4Good/RAPID_A.git
```
* The Run.ipynb notebook will guide you through the whole repository, building data and making inference step-by-step
* Still, making sure the requirements.txt libraries are installed is needed.
* Since for the "general-purpose" CD model we are using codes by El. Aiman et. al., the Tensorflow librray must be at version 45.13.0; as noted in the requirements file (un-installation of a prior TF version might be needed.
